Sentra Firearms Website

This project is my Part 3 submission for WEDE5020 (Web Development).
The website I built is for a fictional company called Sentra Firearms, which sells firearms and related gear. The idea was to create a proper, working website that looks professional, runs smoothly, and includes interactive features made with JavaScript.


About the Project

The goal of this project was to design and develop a functional website that shows what I’ve learned so far in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It’s a multi-page site that includes:
	•	a Home page with a brief intro and a search bar,
	•	a Products page with a working search function and product pop-ups,
	•	an About page explaining the brand’s purpose and values,
	•	a Contact page with a validated contact form, and
	•	an Enquiry page that lets users calculate quotes before purchase.

All of this was done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only — no external frameworks or databases.


Features I Added for Part 3

For this final part of the POE, I added more functionality and improved the overall feel of the website.
Here’s what’s new:
	•	A search bar on both the Home and Products pages that filters products as you type.
	•	Dynamic products that load from JavaScript (no need to hardcode each one).
	•	A modal pop-up that opens when you click “Details” on a product.
	•	Form validation for both the Contact and Enquiry forms.
	•	A price calculator on the Enquiry page that estimates cost and shows availability.
	•	robots.txt and sitemap.xml files for SEO.
	•	General design improvements and smoother transitions.


What I Fixed After Part 2

After getting my Part 2 feedback, I made these improvements:
	•	Made the text easier to read by adjusting colour contrast.
	•	Fixed uneven spacing and margins on some pages.
	•	Reorganised my CSS to be cleaner and easier to maintain.
	•	Added alt text to all images for accessibility.
	•	Tested everything on different screen sizes to make sure it’s responsive.


How to Use

To view the website:
	1.	Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
	2.	Right-click on index.html and click “Open with Live Server.”
	3.	Navigate through the pages using the top navigation bar.

Everything is static and runs locally. You don’t need a database or internet connection (other than to load the Unsplash images).
